		Nomad is a cluster manager, designed for both long lived services and short
		lived batch processing workloads. Developers use a declarative job
		specification to submit work, and Nomad ensures constraints are satisfied
		and resource utilization is optimized by efficient task packing. Nomad
		supports all major operating systems and virtualized, containerized, or
		standalone applications.

Subject: [PATCH 11/29] clone-internal.c: make clone3 syscall optional

We're disabling clone3 for now _CONDITIONALLY_ (not by default) to allow
compatibility with applications using older Electron.

Use -DGENTOO_USE_CLONE3 to enable clone3 for now. In future, we will
revert back to always using clone3.

This was impacting e.g. Discord and Skype. This patch stops glibc from using
clone3 internally (which is the only real use of it) and falls back to the old
behaviour.

Specifically, we want https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/31091
to work its way downstream to various Electron applications.

https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu/+source/glibc/plain/debian/patches/ubuntu/disable-clone3.patch

This is the same as the patch that was considered but ultimately rejected
for 2.34 because Docker got sorted out in time:
